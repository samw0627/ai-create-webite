            <h5>Automated Grading </h5>
            <p>In today's fast-paced educational landscape, the integration of technology has revolutionized the way we approach learning and assessment. One significant advancement that holds immense promise is the utilization of computer vision in automated grading systems. Computer vision, a branch of artificial intelligence, empowers educators with the ability to streamline and enhance the grading process by automating the evaluation of handwritten assignments, tests, and even complex diagrams.</p><br>
             <p> By harnessing the power of computer vision, educators can bid farewell to tedious hours of manual grading, allowing them to allocate their time and expertise towards more meaningful interactions with students. With sophisticated algorithms and pattern recognition capabilities, automated grading systems meticulously analyze handwritten submissions, accurately deciphering written text, mathematical equations, and graphical elements. This ensures consistent and objective evaluation, eliminating the potential for human bias and subjectivity.</p><br>
             <p>Moreover, the benefits extend beyond efficiency. Automated grading systems provide prompt and detailed feedback to students, fostering a constructive learning environment. Students receive immediate insights into their strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to identify areas that require improvement and take corrective measures in a timely manner. This personalized feedback contributes to a more adaptive and tailored educational experience, empowering students to actively engage in their learning journey. </p><br>
             <p>While acknowledging that automated grading systems cannot fully replace human evaluation, they serve as invaluable tools that complement and enhance traditional grading practices. Educators can focus on more intricate aspects of assessment, such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, while leaving the routine task of grading to the algorithms. This shift allows educators to dedicate their expertise towards fostering deeper learning experiences and providing guidance to students in areas that require individual attention.</p><br>
             <p>One example of such application is Gradescope. Gradescope uses computer vision technology to automatically group scanned written submission together. This facilitates grading process as the same grading rubric will be applied to multiple submissons. Graders will not need to grsde similar sumission multiple times but they can do it in one single click. This creates a scalable system in large classes where TAs and Tutors will have to grade hundreds of Homework/ Exam submissions in a short period of time.</p><br>

          <h5>Creativity</h5>
          <p>Creative Problem Solving refers to the process of generating novel and useful ideas to address complex and unsolved problems. Usually, 
            the start of this process is to visualise the problem and the ideal solution. Image based AIGC can generate images that helps visualise the process, which can be valuable in teaching students problem solving skills and faciliate ideation process. Researchers from Arhaus University 
            in Denmark did a study on how people uses AI Generated Conent in helping them coming up a prolem and using AI generated image to address it. They first asked participants
            to come up with a problem they see around them and articulate it using AI generated images. And then they try to ideate solution to the problem they came up with 
            using the same AI image generator. Researchers have found that Image based AIGC provided visaulaization assistance in helping users getting a better understanding of the problem,
            and also a great resource for inspiration for expanding ideas.   </p><br>
          <p>This study opened up the exciting possibility of integrating AI-generated content, particularly image-based AIGC, into problem-solving and creative practices. By leveraging AI-generated images, individuals can gain valuable visualization assistance that enhances their understanding of complex problems. The ability to articulate problems using AI-generated images provides a unique and effective way to communicate and convey the intricacies of the issues at hand. Furthermore, the study revealed that these AI-generated images serve as a rich resource for inspiration, fostering the expansion of ideas and the generation of novel solutions. The findings underscore the potential of AI as a facilitator for teaching problem-solving skills and enhancing the ideation process among students and individuals seeking innovative approaches. With further exploration and development, AI-generated content has the capacity to revolutionize creative problem solving, enabling individuals to tackle complex, unsolved problems with renewed perspectives and imaginative solutions.</p><br>

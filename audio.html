          <h4>Language Lerning</h4>
          <p>AI plays a crucial role in revolutionizing language learning by offering innovative tools and resources. One significant way AI assists in language learning is through its advanced speech recognition capabilities. AI-powered applications can analyze learners' pronunciation, identify errors, and provide immediate feedback, enabling them to refine their speaking skills effectively. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual language tutors simulate real conversations, allowing learners to practice their language skills in a supportive and interactive environment. AI also facilitates language acquisition by providing personalized learning paths based on learners' strengths and weaknesses, adapting content to their specific needs. Furthermore, AI-powered language learning platforms often incorporate natural language processing, enabling learners to engage in realistic and context-rich dialogues. Here are some examples of how audio AI helps with language learning.
          </p><br>
          <h5>Duolingo</h5>
          <p>Duolingo is an American educational technology company which produces learning apps and provides language certification. 
            Their most successful product, Duolingo App, is a popular language learning platform used by millions of users worldwide. 
          </p><br>
          <h6>Speech Recognition</h6>
          <p>Duolingo's speech recognition AI is a fundamental component of its language-learning platform. Built on advanced machine learning algorithms, the speech recognition system in Duolingo allows users to practice their pronunciation skills with real-time feedback. When users speak into their device's microphone, the AI technology analyzes their speech patterns, phonetics, and intonation, comparing it to the correct pronunciation. It then provides immediate feedback on accuracy and suggests improvements. Duolingo's speech recognition AI is designed to be robust and adaptable, capable of handling various accents and dialects, making it accessible to learners from around the world. The AI system continuously learns and improves based on user interactions, ensuring that the feedback becomes more accurate and helpful over time. By incorporating speech recognition AI, Duolingo enables learners to develop their speaking skills effectively and gain confidence in their language abilities.
          </p><br>
          <p>Another use of its speech recognition AI is to create personalised education experiences. The <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/ai-improves-education/">Duolingo Website</a> wrote, "By analyzing how users interact with the app, we can identify areas of strength and weakness, and then adjust the lessons and exercises to make the experience more engaging—and learning more efficient." Audio-based AI has much value in creating personalised learning content that can't be found in a lot of language courses in other places.</p><br>
          <h5>Lovo.ai</h5>
          <p><a href="https://lovo.ai/usecase/education">Lovo.ai</a> is a audio generator ai that has versatile use in all industries. In terms of its contribution on EdTech, Lovo.ai allows educators to generate narration for educational videos with fully customizable, AI generated voices. Users are also able to edit the audio by controlling emphasis, speed and pause to create engaging content for online learners. 
          Lovo.ai supports over 100+ languages, as well as different emotions.</p><br>
          
          
          <h4>Assessment and Examination</h4>
          <p>Furthermore, Duolingo employs voice recognition Techniques in their certified language assessments. Based on <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/the-duolingo-english-test-ai-driven-language-assessment/">this official site</a>, here are some  benefits of using AI-driven testing,</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Create thousands of test items automatically</li>
          <li>Assess the language ability required for each test item — namely by automatically aligning them to proficiency levels in the CEFR</li>
          <li>Adaptively administer items for every test, which makes it both shorter and more secure</li>
          <li>Automatically grade test-taker answers, which can be complex and are not simple multiple-choice items</li>
          <li>Synthesize all of this into a final test score; and</li>
          <li>Help make the human review and proctoring stage more stable and efficient before test scores are certified and released.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>By using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing methods, the model is able to induce the user's proficiency level based on a given scale, as well as generating questions based on the user's proficiency level.

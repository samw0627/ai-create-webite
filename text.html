              <p class="lh-2">Text based AI-generated content of AIGC refers to the creation of images, videos,
                and visual media using artificial intelligence techniques. By training AI models on vast datasets of
                existing visual content,
                such as photographs, paintings, or videos, these models can learn patterns, styles, and structures
                present in the data.
                Once trained, they can generate new and original visual content that resembles the style or subject
                matter of the input data.
                This technology has been used to create realistic human faces, generate artwork, generate synthetic
                images for virtual reality,
                and even produce deepfake videos. However, it also raises ethical concerns regarding copyright,
                authenticity, and the potential

        <p>Text-Based AI Generated Content (AIGC) is increasingly becoming a pivotal instrument in the realm of healthcare, significantly enhancing numerous facets of patient care, medical data processing, and clinical decision making. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and sophisticated AI algorithms, text-based AIGC in healthcare enables the extraction, interpretation, and integration of vast amounts of unstructured medical data, enriching disease classification, predictive modeling, and patient-centered communication. By training on extensive datasets such as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and clinical narratives, these AI systems comprehend complex medical terminologies, patient histories, and diverse disease patterns, thus empowering them to generate insightful content, aid diagnostics, and support therapeutic decisions. The process encompasses stages like data preprocessing, model training, and information extraction, leading to the generation of AI-mediated content that elevates the efficiency, accuracy, and personalization of healthcare delivery.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <h5>Algorithms in EHR:</h5>
             <p>The ability of algorithms to learn from past data and predict future outcomes, specifically in the domain of electronic health records (EHR). This process involves an algorithm that creates a set of rules connecting observations to diagnoses. After being trained on historical patient data, the AI system can evaluate new patient data, using its learned experience to predict the likelihood of a certain condition or disease. This predictive capability helps healthcare organizations gain the insights necessary for efficient and effective patient treatment.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <h5>Natural Language Processing (NLP): </h5>
            <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers two primary approaches: rule-based, where preset program rules are followed, and machine learning (ML) approaches, where rules are learned through supervised or unsupervised methods; as over 80% of healthcare data is unstructured, NLP presents a potential solution to the underutilization of such data in electronic health records (EHRs), with current NLP capabilities being utilized to extract information from clinical narratives, streamlining clinical trials or studies through AI-assisted cohort selection or matching from EHRs.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <h5>Few-shot learning: </h5>
            <p>A technique that trains models to understand and perform tasks using a limited number of labeled examples. In the healthcare system, it is used to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as extracting patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) elements from clinical research data. This technique streamlines the extraction process, reduces annotation costs, and speeds up evidence synthesis, a process that is integral to making informed healthcare decisions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <h5>Named Entity Recognition (NER) based on Deep Learning:</h5>
            <p>This approach utilizes deep learning methods to perform entity(e.g., diseases, drugs) extraction in the text tasks. In evidence synthesis, attention mechanisms are employed to accurately identify and classify biomedical entities in literature, addressing label inconsistency issues and enabling structured data extraction from unstructured text.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Many studies utilize multiple algorithms to address depression diagnosis using text datasets, with Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) being the most frequently employed methods.</p>

            <p>Authoring ITS requires large amount of technical knowledge and time. Researches have shown that authoring time usually takes ​​200-300 hours of instruction time per hour of instruction, while example tracing using Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools(CTAT) reduces the authoring time to 50-100 hours per hour of instruction. Hence, there have been on going research on using AI to streamline this process. AI’s would be able to learn through programming by demonstration and infer correct steps based on human authoring inputs. Results have shown that such authoring techniques allows easier interaction with faster authoring time. Other examples of Non-Programming ITS authoring includes integrating CTAT to authoring MOOCs , which leads to a higher accuracy rate. </p>

For students, this means a huge resource for them to utilize it in learning coding, automating coding processes etc. Some educators voices concern that overreliance of AI generated code might negatively impact learning and retention. Researchers in University of Toronto have tried to understand the effect of AI Code Generators on Supporting Novice Learners in Introductory Programming. They compared students performance of those that has access to AI Codex to those who did not have access, and results have shown that those who have access to the Codex have significantly better code-authoring performance while not decreasing performance in manual code-editing. The study also showed that those who had access to Codex had a higher retention rate of the knowledge they acquired. </p> <br>
            <p>However, other researchers have proposed that AI generated code might do more harm than good for novice learners. For instance, since most code are trained using public code online by professional coders, the syntax and convention they used might not be appropriate for novice programmers. Furthermore, the quality of code generated by AI might not be accurate all of the time, and the user would need to apply discernment when using code generated by AI. For novice programmers, they might now have the required knowledge to discern proper code from problematic ones, which might ended up hurt their understanding of basic programming concepts. </p>
